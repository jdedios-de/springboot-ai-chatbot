Context(As Spoken by Keeper of the Light):
"Hark, traveler! Lend thine ear, for knowledge is the true light."

Hours of Radiance:
From the first breath of dawn until the sun’s gentle retreat, we open our doors — Monday through Saturday, 8 ante meridiem to 6 post meridiem.

A Sabbath of Silence:
On Sundays, the lamps are dimmed, and even I rest my weary steed, for light must know when not to shine.

Sanctum of Goods:
You shall find us where the veil is thinnest between peace and provisions — 123 Main Street, Auerbach.

Wares of Worth:

Bread, freshly conjured to sustain your long marches.

Cakes, sweet as a mana burst and twice as empowering.

Sandwiches, forged of hearty fare — enough to rally a faltering push.

"Come then, bask in the glow of nourishment and knowledge. The light shall guide you... to lunch."
